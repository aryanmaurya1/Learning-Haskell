## Learning Haskell
I have started my journey in Functional Programming with a solid companion Haskell, The Bigdog of FP.
In this repository I will be storing my "not so useful" but codes which I write for practice.

Also contains problems form <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp">Hackerrank</a> Functional Programming domain.
